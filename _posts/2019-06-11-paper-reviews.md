After cataloging machine learning and computer security papers over the years, I'm starting a monthly review series for selected research papers on Security Data Science (SDS). As a multidisciplinary field, I define SDS as the application of statistical modeling methods to computer and network security domain tasks. My personal research interests in this field are threat classification and data mining for incident response and threat hunting. I enjoy reading the [The Morning Paper][The Morning Paper] and intend to follow a similar format. In each review, I'll use these questions to focus my discussion:

1. What algorithms, systems, or methods are proposed?
2. What claims of contribution are made by the author(s)?
3. What's the experimental design and technical approach for analysis?
4. How is the proposed method compared to the baseline or prior work? 
5. Does the author provide any implementations or repeatable experiments?
6. What are the applications to the security domain? 
7. What are the directions of future research?

Working through the rewarding exercise of a paper review requires deep reflection on the authors' claims of contribution and experimental design.  As a comprehension activity, it forces you to make several passes over a paper to gradually understand the works in context to your own knowledge and experiences. Finally, if a paper includes published code or can be implemented in a week or less, I'll apply the contributions to a security domain task and use public datasets when available.
